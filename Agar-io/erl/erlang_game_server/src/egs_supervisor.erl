%%% Module description
%%%
%%% Supervisor for all game processes and registry of current games.
%%%  - Supervision of egs_game_module proceesses
%%%  - ETS tabple is created at startup and automatically detroyed with the process
%%%
%%% List of functions:
%%%   start_game/1      - spawns a new game process
%%%   stop_game/1       - stops a game process, given a game_id
%%%   game_count/0      - get the number of current games
%%%   list_games/0      - list all {game_id, pid} pairs of current games
%%%   lookup/1          - find the pid of a game by game_id
%%%   register_game/2   - called by game processes to register themselves
%%%   unregister_game/1 - called by game processes to unregister on exit
%%% 
%%% list_games,     lookup,     register_game,  unregister_game are just wrap of
%%% tab2list,       lookup,     inster,     delete

%%% Module description
%%%
%%% WebSocket handler; Cowboy will spawn a process for every connected player.
%%%
%%% List of functions, listed in the order they are used:
%%%     init/2              - extract game_id and player_id from the URL, upgrade to WS
%%%     websocket_init/1    - register with the game server
%%%     websocket_handle/2  - handle incoming messages from the browser
%%%     websocket_info/2    - handle messages from game server
%%%     terminate/3         - connection closed, unregister from the game server
%%% note that these names are imposed by the Cowboy framework
